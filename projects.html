                    <li><a href="https://github.com/jessicasmelton/YTCommentAnalysis">Misinformation in the Venezuela-Guyana Border Dispute and Its Impact on Venezuelan Migrants in Guyana</a></li>
                    <br><h4>Completed May 24 - July 23, 2024</h4>
                    <br> <h4>Skills Gained Through This Project:</h4>
                    <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Data Collection and APIs:</strong> Leveraged the YouTube Data API to scrape 21,241 comments from 30 YouTube videos, focusing on topics related to the Venezuela-Guyana border dispute and Venezuelan refugees in Guyana. This involved API authentication, making requests, and handling JSON responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaned and preprocessed the collected comments to prepare them for analysis. This included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters, tokenizing text, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization techniques. Handled errors such as apostrophes being converted incorrectly, e.g., "don't" to "don39t".</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Performed sentiment analysis using TextBlob to determine the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and subjectivity of the comments. Used translation tools to handle comments in multiple languages and ensure they were translated to English for consistent analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Explored text classification models for misinformation detection. Although not fully implemented, gained an understanding of how pre-trained models like RoBERTa can be fine-tuned and applied to detect misinformation in text data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Created visualizations to represent sentiment distribution and analyze correlations. Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create bar charts and line charts to visually interpret the analysis results.</li>
        <li><strong>Programming and Scripting:</strong> Developed Python scripts to automate the processes of data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization. Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Transformers, and TextBlob.</li>
        <li><strong>Research and Analytical Skills:</strong> Applied research methodologies to frame and investigate research questions. Conducted thorough data analysis to derive insights, understand public opinion, and evaluate the impact of misinformation on sentiments towards Venezuelan refugees.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control and Collaboration:</strong> Used Git and GitHub for version control, managing the project's progress, and collaborating with others. Created a GitHub repository to share the project and its resources with the wider community.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Debugging:</strong> Troubleshot and resolved issues encountered during the project, such as handling non-English comments, managing large datasets, and addressing data preprocessing errors. Developed effective solutions to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Planned and managed a complex project from data collection to final analysis and presentation. Documented the project comprehensively, including creating a detailed README file and repository structure on GitHub to guide future users and contributors.</li>
